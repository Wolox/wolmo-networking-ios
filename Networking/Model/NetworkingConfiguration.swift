     - Parameters
     - useSecureConnection: a boolean representing whether the requests
     will be made using a secure protocol. By default it's enabled.
     Take into account in case this is disabled, the appropriate
     exclusions must be added to plist file.
     - domainURL: the base url the requests will be performed against.
     - port: the port the requests will be performed against. By default
     there is no specific port.
     - subdomainURL: the subdomain url to be appended to domainURL to build
     the final url (it can be used to specify API versioning). By default it's empty.
     This url, as a path of the domainURL must start with "/".
     - usePinningCertificate: a boolean representing if SSL Pinning will be
     enabled for the performed requests. By default it's disabled. Take into
     account in case this is enabled, the proper certificate must be included
     into the application bundle resources.
     - timeout: the timeout of the requests in seconds. It defaults to 75 seconds.
     - secondsBetweenPolls: for polling requests, seconds between one polling and the next. It defaults to 1 second.
     - maximumPollingRetries: Maximum retries until a polling request gives timeout. If it's not set then it will use timeout/secondsBetweenPolls
